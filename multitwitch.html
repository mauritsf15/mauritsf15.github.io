  <h1>Privacy Policy for MultiTwitch</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> September 5, 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>MultiTwitch</strong> ("we", "us", or "our") handles information when you use our application. We designed MultiTwitch to respect your privacy. We do <em>not</em> collect, store, or process any personal data on our own servers.</p>

  <h2>1) No First-Party Data Collection</h2>
  <p>MultiTwitch does not require you to create an account and does not collect personal information such as your name, email address, phone number, precise location, or payment details. We also do not store analytics events or logs that identify you.</p>

    <h2>2) Third-Party Services Used in the App</h2>
  <p>Although we do not collect data ourselves, MultiTwitch integrates third-party services that may collect information independently under their own privacy policies. These services include:</p>

    <h3>Twitch (Embedded Player / API)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Purpose: To display Twitch live streams and related functionality.</li>
      <li>Data processed by Twitch (examples): IP address, device and browser identifiers, usage data, cookies and similar technologies, and account information if you are signed in to Twitch.</li>
      <li>Provider: Twitch Interactive, Inc.</li>
      <li>Policy: <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/p/en/legal/privacy-notice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitch Privacy Notice</a></li>
      <li>Terms: <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/p/en/legal/terms-of-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitch Terms of Service</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Google AdMob (Advertising)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Purpose: To show advertising within the app's interface (outside of any Twitch video content).</li>
      <li>Data processed by Google (examples): Advertising identifiers (e.g., Google Advertising ID), IP address, device information, app interactions, and, where enabled, data for personalized ads.</li>
      <li>Provider: Google LLC and its affiliates.</li>
      <li>Policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Privacy Policy</a></li>
      <li>Ad Technology: <a href="https://www.google.com/about/company/user-consent-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EU User Consent Policy</a> â€¢ <a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AdMob &amp; data</a></li>
    </ul>
  <p>Note: These third parties collect and process data directly under their own policies. MultiTwitch does not receive or retain this data.</p>

    <h2>3) Your Choices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ad Personalization:</strong> You can opt in/out of interest-based ads via your device settings (e.g., Reset/Limit Ad Tracking on iOS or Delete/Reset Advertising ID on Android). You may also manage personalization preferences through AdMob's prompts where presented.</li>
      <li><strong>Cookies &amp; similar technologies:</strong> Twitch and Google may use cookies or SDK-based identifiers. You can manage browser cookies and device-level permissions according to your platform's controls.</li>
      <li><strong>Consent in the EEA/UK:</strong> Where required, we (or AdMob via Google's UMP/Consent SDK) will request your consent for personalized ads and applicable data processing. If you decline, non-personalized ads may still be shown.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4) Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>MultiTwitch is not directed to children under 13 (or the equivalent minimum age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

    <h2>5) International Transfers</h2>
    <p>Third-party providers like Twitch and Google may process data on servers located in multiple countries. For details on their transfer mechanisms and safeguards, please review their linked policies.</p>

    <h2>6) Security</h2>
    <p>We do not store user data on our servers. Security for any data processed by third-party services is governed by their own security practices and measures.</p>

    <h2>7) Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Material changes will be reflected by updating the Effective date above. Continued use of {{APP_NAME}} after an update constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.</p>
