        <p>Effective date: 2025-09-03</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Data we collect</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>Local app setting (stored on the device):
                <ul>
                <li>Whether the user completed the tutorial (boolean)</li>
                </ul>
                This value is stored locally using the Flutter SharedPreferences plugin and is not uploaded or shared by the app.
            </li>
            <li>Ads: TossUp uses Google AdMob to display ads. Ad networks may collect device or usage data according to their own policies (see Third-party services below).</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>How we use data</h2>
            <p>The locally stored booleans are used only to control in-app behavior (for example, whether to show the tutorial). The app does not collect personal information, analytics, or any other usage data beyond what is described above.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Ads and third-party services</h2>
            <p>TossUp displays ads through Google AdMob. AdMob and other ad networks may collect information about how ads are served and interacted with. For details about how Google handles data, visit Google's privacy policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>.</p>
            <p>If you want to opt out of personalized ads, follow the device or Google account settings described by Google: <a href="https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922</a>.</p>

            <h2>Data storage and security</h2>
            <p>The boolean flags are stored locally on your device using Flutter's SharedPreferences. They are not transmitted off the device by the TossUp app. We follow standard practices to keep app code secure, but no method of storage or transmission can be guaranteed 100% secure.</p>

            <h2>Children</h2>
            <p>TossUp is not intended for collecting personal information from children. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under applicable minimum ages.</p>
